     don't have lyrics (Except Blockbuster), I gave a few words<br />
     as to why I like each of the songs.</p></h2>

   <h3 id="one">The Armor of God by Xtrullor</h3>
   <p> It is by far one of the greatest song drum & bass songs ever!<br />
    It always gets me pumped up when I'm feeling down.<br />
    And I think the most crazy part about the song is that it's an orchestral drum & bass song.<br />
    A combination that I've never seen done by anyone else other than Xtrullor himself!</p>

   <h3 id="two">ATLAS by BICEP</h3>
   <p>While my only compliant for the song is how off beat the drums sound, I cannot help but vibe to it every time I hear it.<br />
    The song give offs fun and cheery feelings of Summer time! Also passion just because.</p>

   <h3 id="three">Secret Place by CloZee</h3>
   <p>It's very CHILL song.<br />
     The beautiful vocals, the Japanese instrumentals and soft cozy feeling I get when listening to it.<br />
    All that together is what this so great!</p>

   <img src="Champagne Drip.jpg" />
   <h3 id="four">Kaleidoscope by Champagne Drip</h3>
   <p>This song puts me in a 1980s space atmopshere. The bass drops make me feel like the bass is vibrating gently on my ears.<br />
    The song overall gives an aura of being high in sky without anything holding you back.</p>

   <h3 id="five">2011 by ColBreakz</h3>
   <p>The song is absoulute headbanger. Its retro dubstep style is just amazing.<br />
     It's probably one of the only EDM songs that I ask to be played at my funeral and have zero problems with that.</p>

   <h3 id="six">Dance of the Violins by F-777</h3>
   <p>Not much that I can say about this song.<br />
     It is a bop!<br />
     There's no true way to describe how epic it is.<br />
     So I recommend it to anyone who wants something fun to listen to.</p>

   <h3 id="eight">Shooting Stars by EH!DE</h3>
   <p> By far, this is my favorite riddim song ever.<br />
     It bops and it doesn't stop me from dancing to the bass drops.<br />
     And like most of the other songs on this list, it puts me in a happy mood.</p>

   <h3 id="nine">Holography by garlgan</h3>
   <p> A cold hard classic! <br />
     Memories of nostalgia with every listen of this song.<br />
     Nothing much more to say than that.</p>

   <h3 id="ten">Gravity by Wubbix</h3>
   <p>While this was Wubbix's last song before he changed names, I always seem to find myself going back to song over and over again.<br />
   I'm not sure why though.<br />
   Perhaps it is one of those songs I enjoy vibing to every now and then.</p>
